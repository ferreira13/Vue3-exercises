# Vue.js Methods and Action Blocks Component

This Vue.js component, "Methods and Action Blocks," showcases various Vue.js features, including methods, computed properties, and watchers. It demonstrates how you can create dynamic and interactive user interfaces in Vue.js.

## Methods

In this section, the component defines and utilizes several methods for performing actions:

- **Increase and Decrease Total**: You can increase or decrease the `total` value by clicking the "Increase +" or "Decrease -" buttons.

## Computed Props

The "Computed Props" section explores computed properties in Vue.js:

- **Formatted Name**: It formats the user's input in title case.
- **Formatted Name with Getters and Setters**: This version of the "Formatted Name" uses getters and setters to capitalize the user's input.

## Watchers

The "Watchers" section demonstrates the use of watchers to react to changes in a data property:

- **Query**: Users can type something in the input field, and the component watches for changes.
- **API Simulator**: When you click the search button (üîç), the component simulates an API request, and the result is displayed here.

Please explore the component's source code to see how these Vue.js features are implemented and how they can be used in your own Vue.js projects.
